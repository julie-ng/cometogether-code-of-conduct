	<title>Code of Conduct - Diversity Week 2020 at Microsoft Germany</title>
	<meta content="Code of Conduct" property="og:title">
	<meta content="Preamble Microsoft&rsquo;s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. This includes Microsoft events where we seek to create a respectful, friendly, and inclusive experience for all participants. As such, we do not tolerate harassing or disrespectful behavior, messages, images, or interactions by any event participant, in any form, at any aspect of the program including business and social activities, regardless of location. Purpose A primary goal of all the conferences and user groups that refer to this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof). This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in Microsoft Germany’s Charta der Vielfalt Diversity celebrations happening from May 25-29 2020 (or briefly “Diversity Week 2020”) and all related activities, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in our events to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. Open Culture Citizenship A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open culture citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our communities. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure Diversity Week 2020 is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know. Expected Behavior Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of Diversity Week 2020. Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. Attempt collaboration before conflict. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert our Code of Conduct team or other staff if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. Unacceptable Behavior Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in Diversity Week 2020 online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides); inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior Unacceptable behavior from any Diversity Week 2020 attendee, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an attendee engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from Diversity Week 2020 without warning. If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the Code of Conduct team or an organizer as soon as possible. You can find a list of staff and organizers to contact for each of the supporters of this code of conduct at the bottom of this page. Additionally, organizers are available to help attendees engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. Addressing Grievances If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify one of the organizers with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies. Scope We expect all participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all Diversity Week 2020 activities and forums as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to these activities.
